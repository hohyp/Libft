# Libft
C의 표준 함수들을 re-code 합니다.


### Part 1 - Libc functions
In this first part, you must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their man. Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the orig- inals.

### Part 2 - Additional functions
In this second part, you must code a set of functions that are either not included in the libc, or included in a different form. Some of these functions can be useful to write Part 1’s functions.

### Bonus part
If you successfully completed the mandatory part, you’ll enjoy taking it further. You can see this last section as Bonus Points.
Having functions to manipulate memory and strings is very useful, but you’ll soon discover that having functions to manipulate lists is even more useful.
